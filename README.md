# PixiJS Slot Machine

This repository contains a simple slot machine game implemented using PixiJS, a powerful 2D WebGL rendering engine.


### Tools and Technologies Used

- **PixiJS**: A 2D WebGL rendering engine used for rendering graphics and animations.
- **TweenJS**: Optional library for smooth animations and transitions between states.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript syntax and features for application logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure and styling for the web interface.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several JavaScript files that collectively create a slot machine game:

- **main.js**: Initializes the PixiJS application, sets up the game interface, and handles user interactions.
- **slotMachine.js**: Defines the `SlotMachine` class that manages the reels, spins, and game logic.
- **reel.js**: Defines the `Reel` class that represents each individual reel on the slot machine.
- **symbol.js**: Defines the `Symbol` class that represents each symbol on the reels.
